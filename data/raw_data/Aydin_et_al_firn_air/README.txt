Hi Chris,

I attached an Excel file that has the data. All data that are in figures 2c and 2d should be in there. 
If you read the figure caption in the paper and the data labels in the Excel file, everything should be self-explanatory. 
One thing, the HNL and HSL in the paper are labeled as Summit and South Pole in the Excel file. Let me know if there is anything unclear.
