data_set.dat and location_set.dat are read into IDL programs during the REU 2016 and AGU 2016.
uci_station_v2.dat and uci_data_v2.dat are similar but with the longitudes and latitudes checked. They are used during Summer 2017.

84_96_UCI.xlsx was received from Blake at the end of Summer 2017 
It contains the data for the temporal gap of the UCI data.

84_96_UCI_withLongitude.xlsx has longitude values from cross referencing with hydrocarbon.xls and Google Maps.
Longitudes with -999 values are unknown for the sites are either not in the hydrocarbon.xls file or the description is unclear.
